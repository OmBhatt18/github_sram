## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of a 6T SRAM cell design and implementation using a suite of open-source tools, including Magic, OpenRAM, xschem, and ngspice. The research encompasses the complete design flow, from individual component design and simulation (6T SRAM cell, D flip-flop, write driver) to the generation of a 16KB SRAM array layout using OpenRAM.

## Project Highlights
* **Technology Node:** Skywater 130nm PDK
* **Layout Design:** Magic VLSI
* **Memory Compilation:** OpenRAM (16KB Bank)
* **Simulation:** Ngspice & Xschem

## Key Results
The project successfully validated the functionality of the 6T SRAM cell, D flip-flop, and write driver circuits. The final output includes a visualization of the full memory array layout, providing insights into layout complexities and memory tiling.
